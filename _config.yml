  description: "Life is a journey. And the cloud is inheriting our life's complexity. From time to time, I'll have a safari trip into the cloud and this is my journal of what I learned, wanted to share or observed whenever I can write"
  bio: 'Mohamed Sharaf, Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft and curious to learn something new. Love intelligent debate and knowing intelligent people. Amateur cyclist though I do not think I will write about my hobby here. This blog is my personal way to provide high quality material to help a fellow learner understand something, anything. I will not write until there is something worth writing and I will try to update it and engage with comments regularly.'
