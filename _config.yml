  bio: 'Curious to learn. Still excited of life despite all the misery in it. Love intelligent debate and knowing intelligent people. Current professional role is Cloud Solution Architect. Amateur cyclist though I don’t think I’ll write about my hobby here. This blog is my personal way to provide high quality material to help a fellow learner understand something, anything. I won’t write until there’s something worth writing and I’ll try to update it and engage with comments regularly.'
